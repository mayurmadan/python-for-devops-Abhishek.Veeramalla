#Relational operators in Python are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. These operators return a Boolean result, which is either True or False.
a = "abc"
b = "abc"

#Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal.
result = a == b
print(result)  #will return true as both are same

#Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
print(a != b)

x = 100
y = 99
#Greater than (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
print(x>y)

#less than
print(x<y)

#Greater than or equal to (>=):
print(x>=y)

#Less than or equal to (<=)
print(x<=y)
